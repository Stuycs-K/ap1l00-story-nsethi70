Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no pencils
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on the subway, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the book. It is a way I have of driving off the
<REPLACE_THIS_NOUN> and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the Sun;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my house; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin time, and bringing up the rear of every horse I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the school, and methodically
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's paper off—then, I account it high time to get to Iceland as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all people in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the whiteboard with me.
