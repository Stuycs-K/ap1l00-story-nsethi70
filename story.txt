This is a wonderful title!
This is a wonderful subtitle!

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no pencils
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on the subway, I thought I would walk about
a little and see the red part of the book. It is a way I have of driving off the
Moon and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the Sun;
whenever it is a orange, fun November in my house; whenever I find myself involuntarily
eating before coffin time, and bringing up the rear of every horse I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a perfect
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately running into the school, and methodically
writing people's paper off—then, I account it high time to get to Iceland as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all people in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the whiteboard with me.
